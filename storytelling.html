        <h1>Storytelling</h1>
        <p id="stories-introduction">
            In an online world that "surfs" we need some angles for in-depth analysis, niches where to store slightly
            slower and
            more convoluted thoughts. Since I've been dealing with stories, I've always tried to carve out some space
            for how these
            stories interact with me, with the world around me and even with the most remote one. Telling stories that
            are not easy
            to be read, but to be savored as if they were written for a book.<br>Here, in this section there is a little
            of all this.

                    <h2>Elat, Israel</h2>
                    <p>
                        I wake up with lots of new energy.<br>I leave the house and stop to buy a bottle of water
                        because
                        the journey is pure desert, up to Neot Samadar there is nothing, not even any petrol stations,
                        not
                        even houses. I arrive at the curve to leave Mitzpe Ramon and I find some guys with drones, we
                        have
                        a laugh, a selfie, and I jokingly tell them that I'm about to get to Elat by bike, of course
                        they
                        tell me it's not possible and they're right. The journey is fantastic, the first km you descend
                        from Mitzpe Ramon and you can see the beauty of the canyon in every nuance, a spectacle of
                        nature.
                        I'm going quite quickly, the road is good and I seem fit, the first 50-60 km fly by, but about
                        twenty km from Neot Samedar I start to feel pain in my left ankle. The last kms are a bit of a
                        pain,
                        it's still early afternoon and I arrive in Neot Samedar at 15.30, I find a beautiful restaurant
                        with
                        windows all around it, and inside all decorated with plants and wood, it looks like an enclosed
                        garden,
                        beautiful! I recharge the phone and while I take this half hour break I decide, I try to get to
                        Elat.
                        The thought is crazy because my record with the bike, set in 2009, was 120km and I remember the
                        effort. If I succeeded in the enterprise I would conclude at 165 km also considering the
                        internal routes
                        of the city. The problem, however, is obviously not only the distance but also the daylight that
                        abandons
                        you around 7.15pm around here. Without too much ado however, I take off and leave, I'm really
                        determined
                        to make it, but I realize right away that my ankle hurts terribly. I go beyond my standard pace,
                        in the
                        first hours I want to push hard and according to my predictions of the final 75km, the last 15
                        I'll do
                        in the dark. The road is much more complicated than you think, because there are still many
                        climbs to do
                        and there are still about 1500 meters of elevation gain to climb. However, I can't help but take
                        a few
                        short breaks and take some photos, it would be a crime not to tell about this day with a bit of
                        reportage. The sun sets and the shadows of the mountains that I have on my right, from the
                        Egyptian
                        border, are projected on the desert on my left, my eyes are delighted because this road has a
                        truly epic
                        scenography. The sun finally sets 30km from the finish in Elat, and when I think it's the last
                        climb
                        (and then headlong down to the city) there's another incredible climb, then another. I find at
                        least 20
                        last climbs that I almost falter. I'm tired and also worried because the road has narrowed,
                        there's
                        no emergency lane and my lights, in total darkness, don't do much, I wear my reflective shirt to
                        compensate.
                        But it's only a matter of time because around 8 pm I see the lights of the seaside city, the Red
                        Sea, just behind the
                        last mountain.
                        My skin is burned, my legs are two colors, my hands are also starting to burn and hurt and to
                        make matters worse, the
                        screw has loosened on the saddle and now it dances a lot.
                        The last climb is crazy, I have to push the bike by hand, my legs can't hold me anymore, it's
                        too steep, but in the end
                        I'm at the top of the climb and from now on I have the last 9km which is 99% downhill, the kind
                        where you have to use
                        the brakes because they are very deep.
                        The lights of the city begin to light up the asphalt, I can turn off mine, I've arrived.
                        I don't know how but I did it, maybe the desert helped me, or the guiding spirit of the
                        cyclists, but there I am, I did
                        Mitzpe Ramon - Elat in just one day. 165 km I didn't think it was possible but I did it and now
                        I'm enjoying the
                        evening, I'll drink a beer as a reward and eat a delicious Falafel.
                        Pedaling is amazing!</p>

                    <img src="assets/images/story_2.webp" alt="Picture of Alessio Mida with Bahar, a young Jordanian man"
                        class="story-images">
                    <h2>This is Bahar</h2>
                    <p>
                        I can without a doubt say that if there were another 3-4 billion Bahar in the world (perhaps
                        with different faces to
                        give some somatic liveliness), this would be a better place.
                        I meet Ma'an, a city east of Petra, where I am forced to stop to repair the rim of my bicycle.
                        I go down one of the arteries that lead to the highway asking for a "Beskelet Mahala", which in
                        my translation from
                        Italian into Arabic is a "bike shop", because mine is "Maksur", or broken.
                        At the umpteenth person I ask for informations, I find a guy on a bike, who better than him?
                        There is just one problem though, we have to use the translator all the time, because he knows
                        very little English.
                        This 24-year-old boy is him, Bahar, our hero of the day.<br>
                        We do about 35-40 minutes pushing the bicycle, entering this city. Throughout the journey Bahar
                        tells me that his family is Bengali, they ended up here in fits and
                        starts and he is the
                        last of 5 brothers.
                        The parents aren't there, they stayed in Bangladesh and he lives with the only one left here,
                        the others are scattered
                        around the world, the closest to us is in Malta, which he thinks belongs to Italy.
                        He asks me where I will sleep and since I haven't organized anything yet, I tell him I don't
                        know yet, he invites me to
                        his place with no hesitation, I ask if it's not a problem, he replies that it would be nice for
                        him to do it.
                        I accept it then, with great joy. I already know that this will make this negative experience of
                        the bike something very
                        exciting, and I think that this thing can now turn into a traveler's law: the more frustrating
                        the day has been, the
                        greater the reward will be.
                        We find the bike shop and after a loooong Google translator and hordes of kids staring at me and
                        trying to communicate
                        with me, we go to his house.
                        I meet his brother Ousman, who immediately introduce me into the house, showing me their spaces.
                        As a European, I know what I would have thought if I had entered such a place in other contexts,
                        but now, in this
                        moment, my eyes ooze gratitude towards this micro-world, this serene micro-family, Ousman and
                        Bahar, who immigrated from
                        Bangladesh to live in one of the most difficult places in the Middle East.
                        Bahar apologizes all the time, saying "I'm sorry, it's not perfect" but I keep saying that
                        everything is beautiful and
                        saying "Thank you, I appreciate". They open their mouths with sincere smiles, humble but proud,
                        even if their roof is
                        about to fall, they know that the little they have they can always share.
                        Ousman prepares a dinner with fruits and vegetables, some cheese, a smoothie of bananas and
                        strawberries in milk, with 7
                        large spoons of sugar (seen with my own eyes), and wonderful Arab bread that I would like to eat
                        every day of my life.
                        Before dinner, they pray, the sun has finally set, they spread a plastic tablecloth, obviously
                        disposable, on the
                        carpet, and we feast together.
                        Ousman works in a supermarket, in Bangladesh he has a wife and a two-year-old son who has a
                        motorbike, his face is dirty
                        from work, but they also have the bright, shining eyes of an older brother.
                        Bahar wants to open a chandelier shop one day, he makes videos on TikTok, he likes soccer, and
                        always smiles and rolls
                        his eyes when I talk to him about women.
                        After dinner I invite everyone to go out for a drink, but Ousman works. Bahar warms up a pot of
                        water for me and I take
                        a nice shower like I did when I was a child with my grandmother, bowl and cup.
                        Tofik, Bahar's best friend, joins us.
                        I tell them that tonight I would like to repay their hospitality, but Bahar objects, you are a
                        guest, he tells me! I'd
                        like to go where he wouldn't normally go and so he calls a Taxi that takes us to the latest
                        novelty in Ma'an, a coffee
                        shop, which is nothing more than the most lighted shop I have ever seen in my life, they sell
                        sweets and coffee and it
                        stays open up until late, at least during the Ramadan period.
                        We stuff ourselves with cakes, Kunafa, and coffee, I take pictures with the whole bar as if I
                        were Cristiano Ronaldo.
                        We then end up in a gambling den, where Tofik and Bahar try biliards for the first time and here
                        too the scene of the
                        photos repeats itself.
                        The evening at home ends with Bahar worried that I feel cold in his room while for me, after
                        sleeping in a tent, it is
                        warm and beautiful as never before.<br><br>
                        Tonight this arranged little room is more appreciated than the Residence of the King of Jordan.

                    <h2>This is Ramez</h2>
                    <p>
                        During my rest day from cycling (last day) I dedicate myself to those things necessary for the
                        start.
                        This morning I realize that my bike bag is punctured in several places and so I start looking
                        for someone who
                        can fix
                        it.<br>
                        It is then that I find Ramez, boss of a haberdashery in the tangled Amman.
                        R. keeps at work two brothers, a son, two nephews, a mini-dynasty dedicated to the art of
                        sewing.
                        Ramez's English is practically Arabic with Mediterranean gestures but when he asks how much it
                        costs me to do
                        this
                        repair, the communication is effective "Don't worry, I'll do it for free" seems his message.
                        I stay and watch him for the entire hour of work he dedicates to us. He's calm, doesn't huff or
                        get nervous when
                        the
                        huge bag gives him trouble as he spins it on his Singer.
                        His hand seems to dance fast as his feet slide the thread.
                        There is magic in many professions, but in some more than others, and this is one of those that
                        has always
                        fascinated me
                        the most, one of the most romantic that exists, creating garments from threads, but also sewing,
                        repairing what
                        breaks
                        to keep it alive: wonderful!
                        Every now and then he looks at me, smiles and says something to me in Arabic. I almost always
                        answer Shukrun, so
                        as not
                        to be mistaken.
                        In the end it seems to me only right to leave him at least what they would have asked me in
                        Italy, he seems very
                        happy
                        with the gesture and so he says "sit down" as has often happened to me on this trip.
                        Ramez then shows me the Facebook page of his atelier, he is very proud of it and rightly so,
                        even if in real
                        life it
                        looks like a location from Trainspotting and in the photos the interiors of a building by Barry
                        Lyndon.
                        Finally he offers me a coffee and even though I'm a little late for the rush to bring gifts, I
                        gladly accept.
                        It turns out to be undoubtedly one of the best coffees drunk in these 16 days of travel, perhaps
                        because it was
                        the
                        last, perhaps because while I was drinking it I had to immerse myself in so many memories.
                        Goodbye Ramez, if I had your hands and your Singer, I would try to sew everything broken that I
                        have found in my
                        life,
                        the things born broken, the ones that I broke, and above all the things that should never break
                        but which
                        destiny sadly
                        it breaks sometimes and even if you try, there is no Singer to fix.
