                    <p>Mitzpe Ramon, Israel<br><br>
                    It's amazing how you can't even find the time to share the things you do while traveling. I've actually been trying to
                    find the best solutions for many years to invest as little time as possible in sharing, but with the best results. The
                    point is that, if you take time away from days like yesterday, it means that you don't really love yourself üòÖ
                    Mitzpe Ramon will always remain my magical place, the canyon, the town that seems desolate and then suddenly bursts into
                    protests against the government, Roni and her mapping on the mountains, Hassan and his endless joints‚Ä¶and then the
                    girls, Viki, Larissa and Madeline, 3 Germanic souls who I wouldn't have bet anything on their mutual sympathy, but
                    instead they created something unique. And then Jonathan, the guys from the hostel, the two little girls who were
                    celebrating the end of military service.<br><br>     
                    It's really true, if you fell in love with some place it's because you feel good about it, but if you manage to connect
                    with someone and that place has one of the most beautiful canyons in the world, what are we talking about?</p>

                    <p>Elat, Israel<br><br>
                    I wake up with lots of new energy.<br>
                    The day was beautiful the day before, with the visit to the crater, the new friends and the rest.
                    The evening ends at Jonathan's house, a couchsurfer who decides to host me on his sofa. Madeline sleeps in the other
                    room and in the morning we have breakfast together, we say goodbye, and it's already 9, I said I wanted to leave at 8
                    üòµ‚Äçüí´ü§£
                    I leave the house and stop to buy a bottle of water because the journey is pure desert, up to Neot Samadar there is
                    nothing, not even any petrol stations, not even houses.
                    I arrive at the curve to leave Mitzpe Ramon and I find some guys with drones, I know them a little because they make me
                    endearing, they will be between 19 and 20 years old, we have a laugh, a selfie, and I jokingly tell them that I'm about
                    to get to Elat by bike, of course they tell me it's not possible and they're right.
                    The journey is fantastic, the first km you descend from Mitzpe Ramon and you can see the beauty of the canyon in every
                    nuance, a spectacle of nature. I'm going quite quickly, the road is good and I seem fit, the first 50-60 km fly by, but
                    about twenty km from Neot Samedar I start to feel pain in my left ankle.
                    The last km are a bit of a pain, it's still early afternoon and I arrive in Neot Samedar at 15.30, I find a beautiful
                    restaurant with windows all around it, and inside all decorated with plants and wood, it looks like an enclosed garden,
                    beautiful!
                    I recharge the phone and while I take this half hour break I decide, I try to get to Elat.
                    The thought is crazy because my record with the bike, set in 2009, was 120km and I remember the effort. If I succeeded
                    in the enterprise I would conclude at 165 km also considering the internal routes of the city.
                    The problem, however, is obviously not only the distance but also the daylight that abandons you around 7.15pm around
                    here.
                    Without too much ado however, I take off and leave, I'm really determined to make it, but I realize right away that my
                    ankle hurts terribly.
                    I go beyond my standard pace, in the first hours I want to push hard and according to my predictions of the final 75km,
                    the last 15 I'll do in the dark.
                    The road is much more complicated than you think, because there are still many climbs to do and there are still about
                    1500 meters of elevation gain to climb.
                    However, I can't help but take a few short breaks and take some photos, it would be a crime not to tell about this day
                    with a bit of reportage.
                    The sun sets and the shadows of the mountains that I have on my right, from the Egyptian border, are projected on the
                    desert on my left, my eyes are delighted because this road has a truly epic scenography.
                    The sun finally sets 30km from the finish in Elat, and when I think it's the last climb (and then headlong down to the
                    city) there's another incredible climb, then another.
                    I find at least 20 last climbs that I almost falter. I'm tired and also worried because the road has narrowed, there's
                    no emergency lane and my lights, in total darkness, don't do much, I wear my reflective shirt to compensate.
                    But it's only a matter of time because around 8 pm I see the lights of the seaside city, the Red Sea, just behind the
                    last mountain.
                    My skin is burned, my legs are two colors, my hands are also starting to burn and hurt and to make matters worse, the
                    screw has loosened on the saddle and now it dances a lot.
                    The last climb is crazy, I have to push the bike by hand, my legs can't hold me anymore, it's too steep, but in the end
                    I'm at the top of the climb and from now on I have the last 9km which is 99% downhill, the kind where you have to use
                    the brakes because they are very deep.
                    The lights of the city begin to light up the asphalt, I can turn off mine, I've arrived.
                    I don't know how but I did it, maybe the desert helped me, or the guiding spirit of the cyclists, but there I am, I did
                    Mitzpe Ramon - Elat in just one day. 165 km I didn't think it was possible but I did it and now I'm enjoying the
                    evening, I'll drink a beer as a reward and eat a delicious Falafel.
                    Pedaling is amazing!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="stories">
                    <img src="assets/images/story_3.PNG" alt="Picture of Alessio Mida with Bahar, a young Jordanian man">
                    <p>This is Bahar<br><br>
                    I can without a doubt say that if there were another 3-4 billion Bahar in the world (perhaps with different faces to
                    give some somatic liveliness), this would be a better place.
                    I meet Ma'an, a city east of Petra, where I am forced to stop to repair the rim of my bicycle. The feeling is at this
                    point in the journey, the load I've built up, affects the rear too much and the rim no longer holds all the weight.
                    I go down one of the arteries that lead to the highway asking for a "Beskelet Mahala", which in my translation from
                    Italian into Arabic is a "bike shop", because mine is "Maksur", or broken.
                    Along the way, I notice that everyone understands perfectly what I'm saying. I'm speaking arabic üòÇ
                    At the umpteenth person I ask for informations, I find a guy on a bike, who better than him? As soon as I get close he
                    has already framed me, he knows I'm a foreigner, and he waves at me, as if to say "please don't ask me anything, I don't
                    know how to answer in your language" but then he stops and really tries to understand my problem .
                    As usual, after a few kilometers here in Jordan, I quickly become an attraction, on the other hand, few travelers pass
                    here, and when that happens, curiosity must be sky-high.
                    The group of people decides that the boy with the bike will take me directly to the shop.
                    There is just one problem though, we have to use the translator all the time, because he knows very little English.
                    The 24-year-old boy I'm talking it's him, Bahar, our hero of the day.
                    We do about 35-40 minutes pushing the bicycle, getting off and entering this city, which slowly becomes noisier, the
                    sunset is approaching, and even here, in the middle of Ramadan, everything starts to buzz, I see a pick up carrying 3
                    dromedaries on the dumpster, children playing soccer at red traffic lights, cars with removed headlights, chicken shops,
                    and still children who at 7-8 years of age cry out for attention while selling their fruit juices by shaking plastic
                    bottles, and still plastic on the ground, plastic bags flying over your head, plastic everywhere.
                    Throughout the journey Bahar tells me that his family is Bengali, they ended up here in fits and starts and he is the
                    last of 5 brothers.
                    The parents aren't there, they stayed in Bangladesh and he lives with the only one left here, the others are scattered
                    around the world, the closest to us is in Malta, which he thinks belongs to Italy ü•π
                    He asks me where I will sleep and since I haven't organized anything yet, I tell him I don't know yet, he invites me to
                    his place with no hesitation, I ask if it's not a problem, he replies that it would be nice for him to do it.
                    I accept it then, with great joy. I already know that this will make this negative experience of the bike something very
                    exciting, and I think that this thing can now turn into a traveler's law: the more frustrating the day has been, the
                    greater the reward will be.
                    We find the bike shop and after a loooong Google translator and hordes of kids staring at me and trying to communicate
                    with me, we go to his house.
                    I meet his brother Ousman, who immediately introduce me into the house, showing me their spaces.
                    As a European, I know what I would have thought if I had entered such a place in other contexts, but now, in this
                    moment, my eyes ooze gratitude towards this micro-world, this serene micro-family, Ousman and Bahar, who immigrated from
                    Bangladesh to live in one of the most difficult places in the Middle East.
                    Bahar apologizes all the time, saying "I'm sorry, it's not perfect" but I keep saying that everything is beautiful and
                    saying "Thank you, I appreciate". They open their mouths with sincere smiles, humble but proud, even if their roof is
                    about to fall and if you get a quadriceps like a Velociraptor to go to the bathroom (they don't have a proper water
                    closet but just a hole), they know that the little they have they can always share.
                    Ousman prepares a dinner with fruits and vegetables, some cheese, a smoothie of bananas and strawberries in milk, with 7
                    large spoons of sugar (seen with my own eyes), and wonderful Arab bread that I would like to eat every day of my life,
                    Ousman too agrees, the bread here is wonderful.
                    Before dinner, they pray, the sun has finally set, they spread a plastic tablecloth, obviously disposable, on the
                    carpet, and we feast together.
                    Ousman works in a supermarket, in Bangladesh he has a wife and a two-year-old son who has a motorbike, his face is dirty
                    from work, but they also have the bright, shining eyes of an older brother.
                    Bahar wants to open a chandelier shop one day, he makes videos on TikTok, he likes soccer, and always smiles and rolls
                    his eyes when I talk to him about women.
                    After dinner I invite everyone to go out for a drink, but Ousman works. Bahar warms up a pot of water for me and I take
                    a nice shower like I did when I was a child with my grandmother, bowl and cup.
                    Tofik, Bahar's best friend, joins us.
                    I tell them that tonight I would like to repay their hospitality, but Bahar objects, you are a guest, he tells me! I'd
                    like to go where he wouldn't normally go and so he calls a Taxi that takes us to the latest novelty in Ma'an, a coffee
                    shop, which is nothing more than the most lighted shop I have ever seen in my life, they sell sweets and coffee and it
                    stays open up until late, at least during the Ramadan period.
                    We stuff ourselves with cakes, Kunafa, and coffee, I take pictures with the whole bar as if I were Cristiano Ronaldo.
                    We then end up in a gambling den, where Tofik and Bahar try biliards for the first time and here too the scene of the
                    photos repeats itself. On the way out we go get dinner which according to my calculations we would have already had, but
                    because I always forget that I ate at one o'clock and they didn't.
                    The evening at home ends with Bahar worried that I feel cold in his room while for me, after sleeping in a tent, it is
                    warm and beautiful as never before.<br><br>
                    Tonight this arranged little room is more appreciated than the Residence of the King of Jordan</p>
