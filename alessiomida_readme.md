## Design

### Colour Scheme

CSS HEX colours used: <br>
--midnight-green: #004e64ff; <br>
--persian-green: #25a18eff; <br>

![color_palette_alessiomida](https://github.com/ellikarg/FirstEverProject/assets/132999023/d751c685-4474-43a8-8c90-8b5adfda2e42)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

I chose to use Quicksand, which belongs to the sans-serif font family and fits very well to the images and content of the page. The font is one of the favourite fonts of the photographer. I first included the light 300 weigh in order to make it look soft and a little bit playful but then decided to go for the weigh of 400 in oder to succeed in the page being accessiblity friendly and well to read by dyslexic users.

![Quicksand_font](https://github.com/ellikarg/FirstEverProject/assets/132999023/ebe3ab17-9f60-4e72-8d32-b3bb4a97ffc5)

### Imagery

The images have been chosen from the photographer's portfolio. He has the rights to show them in order to display his work.

### Wireframes

Landing page:<br>

Gallery page:<br>
![Gallery](https://github.com/ellikarg/FirstEverProject/assets/132999023/987d50a1-4a4f-4790-b932-fb54acd174c0)<br><br>
Storytelling page:<br>
![Storytelling](https://github.com/ellikarg/FirstEverProject/assets/132999023/969bcaa7-7d8b-4ba4-970f-7fbb01901bd4)<br><br>

## Features

The Website comprises a landing page, a gallery for the photography categories and one page about the art of storytelling.<br>

### General features on each page

All pages are responsive and include:<br>
<ul>
 <li>A navigation bar</li>
 <li>A footer with the social media links to facebook and instagram</li>
</ul>

Missing: I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

In the future this website is supposed to be the real website of Alessio Mida, so it makes sense to include:<br>
<ul>
 <li>A link to his commercial website (which does not exist yet), in order for customers to find directly to his offered services</li>
 <li>Another page about his filmmaker activities, maybe with embedded videos from YouTube (have to be uploaded to YouToube first)</li>
 <li>More categories of his photography activities</li>
</ul>
Another idea we had that can be included with javascript:<br>
<ul>
 <li>embed the stories on the storytelling website as thumbnails like in instagram, which - when clicked on - open up in a popup-window</li>
 <li>a connection to his instagram-page which automatically brings a new instagram post into the storytelling section as a new thumbnail, as a new story</li>

### Accessibility

Missing: aria-labels
 
I use white as a background colour and black or midnight-green for the text. This ensures a very high contrast rate: ![image](https://github.com/ellikarg/firsteverproject/assets/132999023/50d60f33-d32e-4b7e-b05a-27750a6b89c7)

As mentioned before in Typography, I use Quicksand, which belongs to the sans-serif font family and fits very well to the images and content of the page. I am using the weigh of 400, so that the text is easy to read, as well for dyslexic users.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)
